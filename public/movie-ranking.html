    </h1>

    <h2>
    Hi! Here are my top 3 movies of all time!
    </h2>
        
    <h3>
    1. The Godfather
    </h3>
    <p>
    Shit, what's not to like! A grasping tale of power and family survival, where one man's antihero journey, is a war for his very soul.
    </p>
    <h3>
    2. Forrest Gump
    </h3>
    <p>
    An absolute masterpiece: should I have a single movie for all my life, this would be a strong contender.
    </p>
    <h3>
    3. Akira
    </h3>
    <p>
    An absolute masterpiece, deep in cyberpunk lore. Mesmerizing to watch!
